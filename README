ISO50 -- a 50% DIY computer keyboard


There are two variants of the ISO50 keyboard: hand-wired and
PCB-based.  Files and directories that have "pcb" in their name are
part of the PCB-based variant.

The hardware part is covered in directory ./hardware.

Firmware is based on TMK (https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard); see
directories ./firmware or ./firmware-pcb, respectively.

The name of this project refers to the standard 105-key ISO keyboard
layout, reduced to 50 %.  It is not related to anything using the
photography-related connotation of the name.  It is not affiliated
