To build the keyboard, two laser-cut plates, a 3D-printed frame, and a
sticker that covers the screw heads on the bottom need to be made. 

The .dxf files have been created using LibreCAD 2.08.


- top-plate.dxf, bottom-plate.dxf

Files for laser cutting the plates.  Top should be 1.5 mm, bottom
1.0 mm.


- frame.dxf

Various shapes and parameters that are read by frame.scad.  Contains
also a wiring schema.


- frame.scad

Renders the (merely decorative) keyboard frame. 'make frame.stl' should
create a 3D-printable .stl file.  OpenSCAD 2015.03 should work.


- bottom-label-de.svg

Legend image intended to be put onto the bottom of the keyboard.  'make
bottom-label-de.pdf' should create a printable pdf that can be scaled
to A4 size and printed on adhesive film.  Created using inkscape 0.9.1.


- foot-template.dxf

Template for cutting the bottom label, placing the adhesive feet, and
cutting an insulating layer that goes on top of the bottom plate.


Other parts needed:

  contain that much), and an asymmetrical, stepped CapsLock key
