BUGS

- The stabilizer holes seem to be too large.

- Plate corners and screw holes should be drawn with decent arcs.

- The bottom label should be scaled to the correct size; however,
  Incscape crashes when trying to do this.

- The reset hole is somewhat misplaced and should move left by about
  1.5 mm.

- There is a screw head that collides with the stabilizer.
